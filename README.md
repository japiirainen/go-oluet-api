## This is a rewrite of my oluet-api in go!

- The poject was originally written in nodejs, but I decided to start learning glo and thought this was a good place to start exploring!

## Links
- [Homepage](https://oluet-api.xyz)
- [Graphql playground](https://oluet-api.xyz/graphql)
- [API](https://oluet-api.xyz/query)

If you don't know graphql playground is a great place to try out some queries straight from you favorite browser. Give it a shot!

## TODO
1. maybe make a separate type for olut
2. maybe add some small landing page
3. add examples
4. give some basic info
